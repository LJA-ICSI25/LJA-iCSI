C# Notes
(C# is case senstive!)

Commands provided will not work on their own. Setup is required for them to work properly. 
This lesson explains how to set up VSCode to support C#. https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/install-configure-visual-studio-code/

Example of command:
Cosole.WriteLine("Hello World!");

Output:
Hello World!

What each part of it means:
  Console - Defines all outputs will be displayed in the console
  Console is an example of a class


  Write - Outputs a line of text based off the class
  Write is an example of a method
  Multiple Write commands will output on the same line
  Ex:
  Console.Write("Hello");
  Console.Write("Hello");
  Console.Write("Hello");

  Output:
  HelloHelloHello


  WriteLine - Outputs a line of text based off the class
  WriteLine is an example of a method
  Each command of WriteLine will output on a new line
  Ex:
  Console.WriteLine("Hello");
  Console.WriteLine("Hello");
  Console.WriteLine("Hello");

  Output:
  Hello
  Hello
  Hello

Variable - Container for storing a type of value
There are 5 main types
  int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
  double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
  char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
  string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
  bool - stores values with two states: true or false

How to create (declare) a variable
  To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:
  Ex:
  type variableName = value;

type would be int or string
variableName is whatever name given to the variable
value is the value of the variable
Ex:
  string firstname = "Logan";

How to dispaly a variable
  You would normally use a command such as Console.WriteLine();
  Instead of placing your message inside the parentheses, you will place your variable
